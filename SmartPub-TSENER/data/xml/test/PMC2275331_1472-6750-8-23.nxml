Towards this goal, three DNA molecules were employed to investigate the effects of DNA properties on cellular delivery: a circular plasmid DNA (c-DNA), a linearized plasmid DNA (l-DNA) formulated by single-site digestion of c-DNA, and smaller linear gene cassette generated by PCR (pcr-DNA). Four non-viral gene carriers were investigated for DNA delivery: polyethyleneimine (PEI), poly-<italic>L</italic>-Lysine (PLL), palmitic acid-grafted PLL (PLL-PA), and Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122;. Particle formation, binding and dissociation characteristics, and DNA uptake by rat bone marrow stromal cells were investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>For individual carriers, there was no discernible difference in the morphology of particles formed as a result of carrier complexation with different DNA molecules. With PEI and PLL carriers, no difference was observed in the binding interaction, dissociation characteristics, and DNA uptake among the three DNA molecules. The presence of serum in cell culture media did not significantly affect the DNA delivery by the polymeric carriers, unlike other lipophilic carriers. Using PEI as the carrier, c-DNA was more effective for transgene expression as compared to its linear equivalent (l-DNA) by using the reporter gene for Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein. pcr-DNA was the least effective despite being delivered into the cells to the same extent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that the nature of gene carriers was the primary determinant of cellular delivery of DNA molecules, and circular form of the DNA was more effectively processed for transgene expression.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Non-viral delivery systems are being pursued to facilitate therapeutic gene transfer in a clinical setting. Non-viral carriers, such as cationic lipids and polymers, typically interact with the anionic DNA via charged moieties, and condense the long, string-like DNA molecules into compact, nano-sized particles that are suitable for cellular uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A range of cationic lipids and polymers has been engineered to accomplish this function effectively, and intelligent carriers are being continually designed with the purpose of controlling intracellular fate of DNA molecules. Most studies on non-viral gene transfer were conducted with circular plasmid DNA (c-DNA), which is known to be less susceptible to intracellular degradation. Linearized forms of c-DNA (l-DNA) with similar molecular weight, as well as shorter l-DNA that bears only the gene of interest and the promoter region have been used in some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A c-DNA exhibits a higher intracellular diffusivity compared to its linearized forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], which facilitates its nuclear targeting for more effective expression. l-DNA is expected to be prone to nuclease attack intracellularly, but its stability could be increased by capping the 3' and 5' ends of the molecule with hairpin structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Smaller l-DNA molecules, on the other hand, displays better ability to traverse the nuclear membrane, potentially contributing to better translation of the transgene. Studies attempting to directly compare the efficiency of different DNA molecules yielded conflicting results. Whereas Cherng et al. observed better expression of <italic>LacZ </italic>gene when cells were transfected with c-DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], Schakowski et al. observed a similar expression level (based on % transfected cells) for the two DNA topologies with both polymeric and lipid-based carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A difference in the level of gene expression (based on IL-2 expression), however, was noted in the latter study, shorter l-DNA giving enhanced expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In direct nuclear injection studies, with no nuclear transport barriers to DNA molecules, l-DNA yielded more effective gene expression, suggesting an intrinsic superiority of l-DNA for transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Shorter l-DNA molecules with intact promoter/gene regions were even more effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], possibly due to better assembly of transcriptional factors and/or reduced non-specific interactions of proteins with the DNA molecules. The nature of delivery vehicle appeared to influence the transfection efficiency, l-DNA being more sensitive to the choice of the carrier, unlike the c-DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This was indicative of the differences in the transport efficiency among the carriers, but no studies directly compared the efficiency of cell delivery of different DNA molecules.</p><p>This study investigated the non-viral delivery of 3 types of DNA molecules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), namely a c-DNA representing a circular plasmid, a linearized version of the c-DNA after restriction digest at a single site, and a shorter version of the l-DNA amplified by a PCR reaction (pcr-DNA). Four different non-viral carriers were utilized, including 2 cationic polymers commonly used for DNA delivery, poly-ethyleneimine (PEI) and poly-L-lysine (PLL), an in-house synthesized palmitic acid-grafted PLL (PLL-PA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and the most-commonly used commercial lipid Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122;. By using combinations of different DNA molecules and carriers, the influences of DNA molecular weights and topologies on the delivery to bone marrow stromal cells were investigated. These cells, unlike commonly used immortal cells, are an important cell phenotype for clinical protocols. Finally, transgene expression by the three DNA forms were investigated by using the reporter gene Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP). Our results indicated the delivery of all three types of DNA molecules was equally effective for each carrier, with significant carrier-to-carrier differences in delivery rates, but c-DNA were more effective in yielding reporter gene expression as compared to the linearized DNA molecules.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Structure of the DNA molecules used in this study. <bold>A</bold>.

The enzyme was then heat-inactivated by incubating the mixture at 65&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Digested DNA was purified using QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON). Purity of the isolated product was confirmed by spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis was used to confirm the presence of a single band in the preparation.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene Cassette (pcr-DNA)</title><p>The primers, hOPG-F2 (5'-CGAAACAAAACAAACTAGCAAAAT-3') and hOPG-R2 (5'-CCTTTTGCTCACATGTTCTTAATTA-3') was used to synthesize gene cassette from the plasmid pORF9-hTNFRS11b; GFP-F1 (5'-TCCTGCGTTATCCCCTGATT-3') and GFP-R1 (5'-CGCTTACAATTTACGCCTTAAG-3') was used to synthesis gene cassette from the plasmid pEGFP-N2.

The solutions were diluted &#x000d7;100 with ddH<sub>2</sub>O and 1.5 &#x003bc;L of the resulting solution was deposited onto freshly cleaved mica surfaces. Samples were allowed to dry in air for 20 min or until water had visibly evaporated from the surfaces. Experiments were performed with MFP-3D-BIO (Asylum Research; Santa Barbara, CA) operating in tapping mode (AC) using standard silicon cantilever (AC240TS) with ~2 N/m spring constant and 70 KHz working frequency. All images were recorded in air at room temperature inside an acoustic enclosure, and on a vibration isolation table at a scan speed of 1 Hz.</p></sec><sec><title>Particle Size Measurement</title><p>The diameter of the particles formed by carrier/DNA complexes was measured by photon correlation spectroscopy (ZetaPALS, Brookhaven Instruments, Holtzville, NY). Four microgram of DNA was complexed with the appropriate volume of polymer solution at a carrier/DNA weight ratios of 5, 7.5 and 10 in a total volume of 50 &#x003bc;L diluted with 150 mM NaCl. The complexes were left to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes, then diluted to 2 mL with DMEM and incubated for another 30 minutes before analysis. The measurement time was set at 30 seconds intervals and each run consisted of 10 consecutive measurements (SD among the measurements was typically ~1%). Particle sizes were measured at a wavelength of 660 nm and calculated by using a medium viscosity of 1.140 cP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and a refractive index of 1.333 (at 25&#x000b0;C).</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Assay (EMSA)</title><p>Electrophoretic mobility of carrier/DNA solutions was performed by loading the complexes (see preparation condition below) into a 0.7-0.8% agarose gel containing 1 &#x003bc;g/mL of Ethidium Bromide in 1&#x000d7; Tris-Acetate/EDTA buffer. The agarose gel was run with 115 V of current for ~20 min and the DNA bands were visualized using the Alpha Imager (Alpha Innotech; San Leandro, CA). Mean fluorescent density (in arbitrary units) of each band was measured by the manufacturer-supplied software.</p><sec><title>Analysis of Carrier-DNA Binding</title><p>200 ng of DNA was first suspended in 100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 5.2), carriers were then added to DNA solutions at DNA:carrier weight ratios of 2, 1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, and 0 in a final volume of 15 &#x003bc;L, and the solutions were allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were then loaded into the gel as described above. The amount of free DNA in each lane was quantitated by densitometric analysis. The percentage of DNA bound was calculated from the fluorescent density (<bold>F</bold>) values as: % DNA bound = {<bold>F</bold>(DNA only) - <bold>F</bold>(specific DNA-polymer ratio)} &#x000f7; {<bold>F</bold>(DNA only) - <bold>F</bold>(background)}&#x02022;100%. %DNA bound vs. carrier:DNA ratios were plotted, and used to obtain a carrier/DNA-specific IC<sub>50 </sub>value, indicating the carrier:DNA ratio that gave binding to 50% of the DNA in the sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of Carrier-DNA Complex Dissociation</title><p>350 ng of DNA molecules in 150 mM NaCl were complexed with 3 &#x003bc;g of polymer in a final volume of 10 &#x003bc;L for 30 min at room temperature. Then, 10 &#x003bc;L of either basic medium (with 10% FBS) or 10 &#x003bc;L of DMEM was added to the samples, and incubated at room temperature for an additional 1.5 hours. Heparin sulfate were then added at a final concentration range of 0.02-32 &#x003bc;g/mL and the samples were incubated for 30 min. The samples were then loaded onto the gel and visualized as described above. The percentage of DNA dissociated was calculated from the fluorescent density (<bold>F</bold>) values as: %DNA released = {<bold>F</bold>(specific heparin concentration) - <bold>F</bold>(background)} &#x000f7; {<bold>F</bold>(DNA only) - <bold>F</bold>(background)}&#x02022;100%.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Cell Culture and DNA Uptake</title><p>Rat bone marrow stromal cells (rBMSC) were isolated and cultured as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Briefly, cells were isolated from both femurs of 8-week old female Sprague-Dawley rats and pooled to obtain a single suspension. The bone marrow was flushed out with 15 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS, 50 &#x003bc;g/mL ascorbic acid, 100 U/mL Penicillin and 100 &#x003bc;g/L of Streptomycin (referred to hereon as basic medium). Cells were centrifuged for 6 min at 600 rpm, suspended in fresh basic medium and seeded in a single 75 cm<sup>2 </sup>flask (Sarstedt; Montreal, QC). After medium change on day 3, the cells were trypsinized on day 7 and expanded in 75 cm<sup>2 </sup>flasks (1:4 dilution). The rBMSC passaged between 2-4 generations were used in this study, and were grown in multiwell plates for DNA uptake studies.</p><p>To investigate DNA uptake, 20 &#x003bc;g of DNA was labeled with Cy5.5-NHS as suggested by manufacturer's protocol. Labeling reaction was stopped by the addition 100 mM Tris-Cl to quench the pre-activated succinimide ester moiety. Labeled DNA was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) then again with ddH<sub>2</sub>O. The samples for uptake were prepared with 5 &#x003bc;L of the labeled DNA solution added to 2, 6 or 18 &#x003bc;g of the polymer (0.3, 1 and 3 &#x003bc;g for branched PEI) in a final volume of 40 &#x003bc;L. The samples were added directly to the rBMSC grown in 6-well plates with 2 mL of basic medium. Each polymer concentration was typically tested in duplicates. Cells are incubated for 24 hours at 37&#x000b0;C (5% CO<sub>2</sub>), after which they were washed with HBSS (x2), trypsinized for 5 min for detachment and suspended in HBSS with 4% formalin. Fluorescence was measured at &#x003bb;<sub>em </sub>= 690 nm and &#x003bb;<sub>em </sub>= 705 nm. The results were expressed as the percentage of cells exhibiting significant fluorescence over that of control samples (i.e. cells exposed to DNA with no polymer), which was set to ~1% uptake. In same cases, the uptake was expressed as the average fluorescence exhibited in cells (in arbitrary units).</p></sec><sec><title>Transfection and Assessment of EGFP Expression</title><p>Two cell types were used for assessment of transgene expression, primary rBMSC and immortalized HEK 293T cells. BMSC were cultured and maintained as described in the DNA uptake studies. HEK 293T cells were seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates supplemented with DMEM media containing 10% FBS. When cells reached ~80% confluency, they were transfected with PEI/DNA complexes prepared at a polymer/DNA weight ratio of 2.5 (PEI:DNA concentration of 5:2 &#x003bc;g/mL in tissue culture medium). Complexes were incubated at room temperature for 25 minutes then added directly to cells covered in a basic medium. The cells were allowed to incubate at 37&#x000b0;C in the presence of complexes for 24 h followed by replacement of 1 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS. Transfected 293 cells were either processed for flow cytometry following complex removal (24 hours), or incubated for another 72 hours before assessment of EGFP expression by flow cytometry. BMSC were processed 48 hours after complexes were removed. Flow cytometry was performed on a Cell Quanta SC with MPL Option (Beckman Coulter) where the EGFP fluorescence was detected in the FL1 channel. The instrument settings were calibrated for each run so as to obtain a background level of EGFP expression of ~1% for control cells. The latter included (i) cells treated with 2 &#x003bc;g/mL of c-DNA, l-DNA and pcr-DNA without any carriers, and (ii) cells treated with PEI/gWiz-blank plasmid that contained no functional genes (to ensure that internalized complexes do not provide a non-specific fluorescence in flow cytometry).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Where indicated, all results are summarized as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, and statistical variations (p &#x0003c; 0.05) between the group means were analyzed by the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Particle Formation</title><p>The three DNA molecules were mixed with various gene carriers in solution to examine particle formation and morphology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). When DNA molecules were examined under AFM in the absence of carriers, a network of interconnecting fibrous strands was observed, especially for c-DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>) and l-DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f</xref>), whereas pcr-DNA appeared as discontinuous strands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2k</xref>). When branched PEI was added to the DNA solutions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b, 2g</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2l</xref>), spherical particles were observed for all three types of DNA molecules with no evidence of string-like DNA molecules. The sizes of the particles ranged from ~40 nm to ~180 nm in diameter, and were independent of the type of DNA molecules used. Similar observation was noted for particles obtained with PLL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c, 2h</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2m</xref>) and PLL-PA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d, 2i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2n</xref>). The sizes of the particles formed by the PLL and PLL-PA were equivalent to those formed by the branched PEI. The cationic lipid, Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122;, also bound and condensed c-DNA and l-DNA into spherical particles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2j</xref>). However, the sizes of some of the particles were significantly larger, with some particles being as large as ~450 nm. Some particles were observed when pcr-DNA were mixed with Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2o</xref>), but isolated islands of presumably Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122; formed over the mica surface covering some of the DNA molecules. Although we followed the manufacturer's instructions for DNA condensation in the latter case, excess lipid was apparently present in these solutions.

Three different carrier:DNA ratios were used to investigate its effect on particle sizes. Whereas some combinations (e.g., PLL-PA and PEI combined with c-DNA) gave the expected decrease in size with increasing carrier:DNA ratio, other combinations (e.g., ones involving l-DNA and Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122;) did not give a predictable pattern. Particles from Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122; were generally larger for each DNA molecule, and, in some cases, no stable measurements could be taken either due to visible precipitation of the complex solution or formation of large particle aggregates. This was consistent with the AFM observations on Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122; complexed DNA molecules. With PLL-PA, l-DNA gave relatively larger particles (~350 nm) as compared to c-DNA and pcr-DNA (100-160 nm).

Preliminary studies using pEGFP-N2 with PLL, PLL-PA, Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122; and PEI indicated the PEI to be the most effective carrier in our set up (data not shown). Therefore, subsequent expression studies were performed by using PEI as the sole carrier and the three types of DNA molecules to specifically focus on the relative effectiveness of each DNA molecule for the expression of reporter gene (rather than focusing on the effectiveness of each carrier). To determine if the enzymatic manipulations used to generate the l-DNA and pcr-DNA yielded functional gene constructs, transfections were initially carried out in HEK 293 T cells since they are considered to be a readily-transfectable cell phenotype. The results obtained from these cells are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>. The c-DNA was the most effective form of DNA based of percentage of EGFP-positive cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>), giving ~90% cells with EGFP expression on Day 1. Transfection efficiency using l-DNA and pcr-DNA were significantly lower: ~61% and ~48% EGFP-positive cells, respectively. On Day 4, the percentage of EGFP-positive cells was reduced for c-DNA and l-DNA (but not pcr-DNA) transfected cells as compared to Day 1. The relative mean fluorescence values of the EGFP-positive cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>) were used as a measure of extent of EGFP expression; the c-DNA transfected cells displayed ~3.5 and ~2.5 fold increase in mean fluorescence over l-DNA and pcr-DNA transfected cells, respectively (Day 4). Non-treated cells, as well as the cells exposed to the three forms of DNA alone (i.e., without any carrier) gave results similar to the cells treated with PEI/gWiz complexes (not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Transfection efficiency of c-DNA, l-DNA, and pcr-DNA using PEI as the gene carrier in HEK 293T Cells (<bold>A </bold>and <bold>B</bold>) and rBMSC (<bold>C </bold>and <bold>D</bold>).

Previous studies have examined the effects of DNA molecular weight and topology on transfection efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] but failed to study the intracellular delivery of different DNA molecules <italic>per se</italic>. We employed three types of cationic polymers and one cationic lipid to determine if common non-viral gene carriers would have the same delivery efficacy using different physical forms of DNA. To compare the effects of physical properties alone on cellular uptake, all DNA molecules were manipulated from a single source of circular plasmid DNA extracted from bacteria. l-DNA and pcr-DNA were prepared by restriction digest and PCR, respectively, using c-DNA as the source or the template. The procedures were optimized to obtain homogenous products without gel electrophoresis. It is known that EtBr/UV light combination damages DNA by inducing strand breakage and oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. To avoid this potential artifact, all DNA preparations have been performed in the absence of EtBr.</p><p>The ability of gene carriers to bind DNA and condense the molecule into particles is assessed qualitatively by AFM and quantitatively by photon correlation spectroscopy. AFM assessment indicated that the cationic polymers were able to condense all three types of DNA molecules into spherical particles with no discernible morphological differences. A variation in particle sizes was evident for individual carriers in AFM measurements, but size ranges appeared to overlap between the types of DNA molecules. Photon correlation spectroscopy indicated the PEI complexed DNA to be larger than the PLL-PA particles. The smaller size of the particles obtained from AFM is not surprising, considering that they were obtained under 'dry' condition which is likely to represent a collapsed state of the particles. The type of DNA molecule was a determining factor in the sizes of particles formed with the polymeric carriers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122; also condensed DNA into spherical particles for both c-DNA and l-DNA, and the particles were similar in size to those observed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, full condensation did not occur for the pcr-DNA at the weight ratios used in this experimental set-up. This was also the case for these particles from photon correlation spectroscopy measurements. Based on semi-quantitative EMSA analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], no significant differences in the binding interaction among the three types of DNA molecules was evident for each carrier. Branched PEI was able to completely condense DNA at lower polymer-to-DNA weight ratio compared to other carriers. Both PLL and PLL-PA were able to completely condense DNA at the same ratio, however, the modification of PLL with palmitic acid led to an increase in binding affinity, contrary to the observation reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The combination of AFM and EMSA results pointed to no apparent differences between the DNA molecules and their interaction with the carriers. It was interesting to note that EMSA results (indicating 100% binding at carrier:DNA ratios of &#x02264;1), were mostly consistent with the AFM results, which indicated no free DNA at the carrier:DNA ratio of 1. The only exception was the results from Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122;, where complete binding was seen at the carrier:DNA ratios of ~3, whereas AFM indicated no free DNA (for c-DNA and l-DNA) at the ratio of 1. It was possible that Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122; complexation led to more fragile particles that did not withstand the electrophoretic forces under EMSA assay conditions.</p><p>Dissociation of DNA from gene carriers is essential for efficient gene expression because access by the transcription machinery requires free and intact DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The dissociation characteristics of the complexes were studied using heparin sulfate as a competitive polyanion to disrupt the interaction between the carriers and DNA molecules. Heparin sulfate is an anionic polysaccharide known to be a major component of extracellular matrix, and have been shown to inhibit DNA delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It was used here to mimic the conditions that particles encounter under cell culture conditions. For DNA complexes formed with PEI and PLL, there was no significant difference in the dissociation profile among the three types of DNA molecules. With both vectors, however, DNA could not be fully dissociated from the complex. This may be due to a rate-dependent reorganization process that takes place after the initial complexes were formed, leading to a 'mature' complex with stronger electrostatic interaction that cannot be easily disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Complexes of PLL-PA and Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122; showed a different dissociation profile among the three types of DNA, where linear forms of DNA molecules were dissociated to a greater extent than the c-DNA. This suggested that a similar maturation process exist for the lipoplexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and the extent of maturation varied among the different topologies of DNA. Grafting of the fatty acid palmitic acid on PLL renders a partial lipophilic characteristic to the cationic polymer, and is likely to account for the similarity in the dissociation profile to that of Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122;, that is, with c-DNA being the least dissociated. Overall, our results suggested a similar efficiency in the unpacking of vector (dissociation) among the three DNA molecules for the polymeric carriers, but not for the lipid-based carriers whose dissociation was stronger with l-DNA molecules. Since expression of the transgene (OPG) was not explored in this study, it remains to be determined whether such a difference in dissociation would ultimately lead to differences in expression efficiency for different DNA isoforms.</p><p>With respect to DNA delivery to the cells, we observed no major difference in the level of DNA uptake among the three physical forms of DNA molecules. This was the case despite the fact that average particle sizes were found to depend on the nature of the DNA molecule. It is possible that significant variations in particle sizes in each complex preparation might have masked such a possible effect. Different routes of entry (i.e., clathrin- vs. caveolae-mediated) could also have been utilized by different complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], but our studies were not designed to probe these differences. It must be pointed out that serum could not be used during photon correlation spectroscopy due to unstable readings obtained. Any changes in particle sizes in the presence of serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] might complicate our understanding of size effects on the DNA delivery. However, there was a difference in the delivery efficiency of DNA among the carriers. PEI was able to deliver DNA to cells at much lower concentrations and was the most effective carrier of the four examined. PLL was the least effective carrier for DNA uptake and its performance was comparable to when no carrier was used. In previous studies, PLL was shown to be readily taken up by the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] but it appeared that its ability to carry a DNA cargo was relatively low. This is in contrast to the results obtained in other studies when fluorescent microscopy was used to detect DNA uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The low level of uptake observed in this study may be attributed to the low sensitivity of the flowcytometer or a high cut-off level set up with the control samples (i.e. no carrier). There was no apparent correlation between particle formation, polymer-DNA interaction, complex dissociation and the DNA uptake. For example, PLL, despite showing typical DNA binding and dissociation activity, did not enable an equivalent DNA level of delivery into cells when compared to other carriers. This conclusion was valid for all three DNA molecules used in this study.</p><p>The presence of serum during cellular internalization of complexes did not influence the uptake of complexes of pure cationic carriers PEI and PLL, but did influence delivery by the lipophilic Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122; and PLL-PA. This may be due to serum inhibition of the complex maturation process, resulting in reduced uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The fact that 24-hour uptake was still influenced by the presence of serum suggested the maturation process to last throughout this time period. Serum has previously been described to inhibit lipofection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] as well as DNA uptake of lipoplexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. For PLL-PA, only the linear forms of the DNA were affected by the serum. Given its partial lipophilic characteristic, the difference in the level of uptake may be directly related to the rate of complex maturation mentioned earlier. The observation that l-DNA is affected to a greater extent than pcr-DNA may be attributed to size differences between the molecules. Larger l-DNA was expected to take longer to reorganize itself into the matured complex; this may cause it to become more susceptible to binding by serum proteins than smaller l-DNA. All polymers resulted in an increase in absolute amount of DNA delivery from 4 to 24 hours, suggesting that the uptake pathway is a rate-limiting process for these carriers. Furthermore, PLL-PA showed a significant increase in absolute amount of DNA delivery in the absence of serum, where a similar increase was absent in Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122;. Serum thereby affected PLL-PA differently than the Lipofectamine-2000&#x02122;. The difference in the degree of sensitivity to serum can be accounted for by the nature of the lipid groups (monovalent vs. multivalent) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], in addition to the polymeric nature of PLL-PA, which contributed to the continued uptake of complexes in the absence of serum.</p><p>The transfection results from both 293 cells and rBMSC showed that the supercoiled circular plasmid DNA was more effective topology for transfection than its linearized equivalent of the same molecular weight. This observation was consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Remaut et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] attributed better translocation of c-DNA to perinuclear regions for better transgene expression by the c-DNA. We have further investigated the effectiveness of a gene cassette, which is approximately half the size of the linearized plasmid DNA; pcr-DNA was even less effective than l-DNA, even though the number of gene-encoding templates was expected to be twice that of l-DNA or c-DNA (per unit mass basis exposed to the cells). The carrier-DNA interactions (either binding or dissociation) were not expected to be different between the l-DNA and pcr-DNA at a given carrier:DNA ratio, as well as the uptake into the cells (data from Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Thus, the difference in transfection efficiency between l-DNA and pcr-DNA cannot be explained from these considerations. The only difference between these two DNA molecules was in the hydrodynamic diameter of the complexes, where pcr-DNA gave smaller particles compared to l-DNA, but our data on this issue is too limited to probe a correlation between transfection and complex size. The difference observed in transfection could be attributed to intracellular response to the DNA itself. Several factors might come into play, including; (i) different rates of intracellular degradation of the DNAs (the smaller pcr-DNA could be more sensitive to degradation due to lower content of ectopic sites), and (ii) ease of accessibility of the template to transcription factors (the promoter of the smaller pcr-DNA might be more effectively blocked with the carrier as compared to the longer l-DNA). It is also possible that different types of DNA molecules would elicit different metabolic responses. For example, double-stranded l-DNA and pcr-DNA have exposed 5'-phosphate groups on their ends, which resemble damaged DNA. When introduced into cells, these DNA molecules might cause an inhibition of overall gene expression as a protection mechanism against aberrant expression, effectively reducing transgene efficiency. Still other factors may come into play, but this study was not intended to explore the intracellular fate and consequences of exogenous DNA delivery. Further studies on these issues will be conducted in the future to explain the difference in transfection efficiency among different DNA molecules.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this study aimed at evaluating the delivery of different sizes and topologies of DNA by non-viral carriers. We have shown that there were no discernible differences in either the <italic>in vitro </italic>binding interaction to the gene carriers or the efficiency of uptake between either the circular and linear forms or between large and small DNA molecules. There was some effect on uptake and complex interaction in the presence of serum, but this difference was mostly influenced by the nature of the carrier itself, rather than the inherent properties of the DNA molecules. With the chosen PEI carrier, c-DNA was found to be more effective than the linearized DNA molecules for transgene expression. Better delivery of c-DNA into the cells was not the reason for its better performance, since the chosen carrier was able to efficiently deliver all DNA molecules into the cells regardless of their sizes and topologies. Intracellular processing of the DNA molecules was more likely to be the underlying reason for better efficiency of c-DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CYMH carried out all the experiments as outlined in the methods.
